              <ol>
  <li>Gain King and Queen Opposition: First, position your queen so that it opposes the opponent's king with your own king in a straight line. This means placing your queen and king on the same rank, file, or diagonal as the opponent's king.</li>
  <li>Drive the Opponent's King to the Board Edge: Slowly push the opponent's king toward the edge of the board. Use your queen to restrict the king's movement and limit its options. Coordinate your queen and king to create a "net" that prevents the opponent's king from escaping.</li>
  <li>Maintain the Opposition: As you approach the edge of the board, maintain the opposition with your king and the opponent's king. This means ensuring that there is always one square between the two kings horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
  <li>Cut off Escape Squares: Gradually cut off the opponent's king from reaching the remaining squares on the board. Use your queen to control key squares and prevent the opponent's king from finding shelter or escape routes.</li>
  <li>Create Zugzwang: Zugzwang is a situation where the opponent's king is forced to move and worsen its position. Use your queen and king to create zugzwang by limiting the opponent's king's available moves and gradually tightening the noose.</li>
  <li>Mate on the Board Edge: Once the opponent's king is pushed to the edge of the board, position your queen and king to deliver checkmate. Place the opponent's king in checkmate by attacking it with your queen in a way that leaves no legal moves to escape or block the check.</li>
